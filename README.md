DISCLAIMER: This project was made for studying and practicing purposes only.

Python webscraping app for online sports betting site.

According to certain parameters specified in the code, this app interacts with the buttons on the page until it places a bet.
Then, the program periodically checks the bet's status for a win or loss result.
Depending on the result, the next bet will follow specific instructions on it's loop.

This program applies betting strategies and a custom algorithm based on the site's algorithm, but it lacks deep data analysis.
For example, there are no studies on player's records, stats, match history, etc.
This could eventually be perfected, but the intention of this project is to build a betting system as simple as possible.

This program has had big wininng streaks, but it's still far from generating proper revenue, so IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED to use it for such purposes.
At the time, finer betting strategies and deep analyses are required to take this app to an advanced step.
But, as stated at the top of this file, this project was created to tinker with Selenium and basic data analysis practices, so it's unlikely that further development will take place.
